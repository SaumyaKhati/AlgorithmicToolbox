# Algorithmic Toolbox
This project contains contains the solutions for all of the programming challenges listed in the online Coursera Course: Algorithmic Toolbox which is part of the 2020 Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization as offered by Google. There are 6 modules in total in the course and each module/week offers different topics/exercises related to algorithms. For example, Week 3 discusses greedy algorithms and Week 4 discusses sorting algorithms. 

The project is conveniently divided for other users. Each week/module has its own folder labelled by Week #. All of the problems for a particular week are in a single Main.java file, but they are all separated into their individual methods. 

The methods for each problem have comments to explaing the logic behind the solutions. **NOTE:** Some comments are quite large because I want to ensure that people reading my solutions clearly understand the logic behind the implementation as well as the key ideas needed to solve the problem. 

**NOTE:** All methods as well as input statements for problems are commented out as default. Therefore, to use the method, you have to uncomment the method pertaining to the problem as well as the input parsing statements which are collectively placed under the comment: "//for problem x". Under such a comment, you will find all code required to run the method pertaining to that problem.
