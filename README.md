# Algorithmic Toolbox
This project contains will contain the solutions for all of the programming challenges listed in the online Coursera Course: Algorithmic Toolbox which is part of the 2020 Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization as offered by Google. 

There are 6 modules in total in the course and each module/week offers different topics/exercises related to algorithms. For example, week 2 discusses greedy algorithms and week 3 discusses sorting algorithms!

Each module has its own folder labelled by Week #. Each of the problems have their own methods for all modules.

Current Status: I have added solutions for all exercises in Week 1 and 2 as well as 6/7 problems for Week 3. I am working on completing solutions for problems 7 and then working on Week 4. I am also adding comments to all of the methods to explain the logic behind the solutions.
