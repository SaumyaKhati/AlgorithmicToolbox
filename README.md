# AlgorithmicToolbox
This repository contains my solutions for all problems in the course: Algorithmic Toolbox (which is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization offered 
by the University of California San Diego). 

Important Notes:
  1) The project is divided into weeks 1-6 represeting the course modules. 
  
  2) For each week, all of the problems are separated in their own methods (ex: problemOne(), etc). There may also be "helper" methods related to a problem
     that must also be uncommented in order to run the code properly. 
     
  3) All solution methods are commented out as a default. Therefore, to test the code for a particular problem, you need to uncomment the relevant code (which might 
     be multiple methods if that problem required it so). 
     
  4) For each problem, it contains its own set of input parsing statements in the main method. Worry not however, because they are divided conveniently via comments 
     such as "//For problem 2". Under that comment, you would find input parsing statements that need to be uncommented to read cases for problem 2 of that particular week.
  
  5) All problem methods have header comments that explain how to solve the problem and the logic behind my implemented solution. As a result, some of the comments
     can be long but please make sure to read it as it will clarify the solution and give you key ideas that may allow you to solve the problem yourself.
