# Algorithmic Toolbox
This project contains will contain the solutions for all of the programming challenges listed in the online Coursera Course: Algorithmic Toolbox which is part of the 2020 Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization as offered by Google. 

There are 6 modules in total in the course and each module/week offers different topics/exercises related to algorithms. For example, week 2 discusses greedy algorithms and week 3 discusses sorting algorithms!

Current Status: I have added solutions for all exercises in Week 1 and 2 and have code for exercises 1-4 out of 7 for Week 3. I am working on completing solutions for problems 5-7 and then working on Week 4.
