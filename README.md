# Algorithmic Toolbox
This project contains will contain the solutions for all of the programming challenges listed in the online Coursera Course: Algorithmic Toolbox which is part of the 2020 Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization as offered by Google. There are 6 modules in total in the course and each module/week offers different topics/exercises related to algorithms. For example, Week 3 discusses greedy algorithms and Week 4 discusses sorting algorithms. 

The project is conviniently divided for other users. Each week/module has its own folder labelled by Week #. All of the problems for a particular week are in a single Main.java file, but they are all separated into their individual methods. The methods for each problem are also commented to explaing the logic behind the solutions. 

Current Status: I have added solutions for all exercises in Week 1 and 2 as well as 6/7 problems for Week 3. I am working on completing solutions for problems 7 and then working on Week 4. Comments have not yet been added for Week 1/2.
